## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration

Our CI pipeline runs on every push and pull request:

- **Code Quality**: Formatting, linting, and analysis
- **Testing**: Unit tests with coverage reporting
- **Building**: Multi-platform builds (Android, iOS, Web)
- **Artifacts**: Build outputs are stored as artifacts

### Continuous Deployment

- **Releases**: Automatic release creation on tag push
- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning (SemVer)
- **Artifacts**: Release builds for all platforms

### Workflow Triggers

- **CI**: Triggers on push to `main`/`develop` and PRs
- **Release**: Triggers on version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`)

## 📊 Code Quality

- **Dart Analysis**: Static analysis with `flutter analyze`
- **Code Formatting**: Automatic formatting with `dart format`
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum coverage requirements enforced
- **Linting**: Consistent code style enforcement

## 🚀 Release Process

1. **Version Bump**: Update version in `pubspec.yaml`
2. **Create Tag**: Create and push a version tag
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```
3. **Automated Release**: GitHub Actions automatically creates a release
4. **Deployment**: Release artifacts are available for download
